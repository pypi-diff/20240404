-# GraphSL: Graph Source Localization Library
-
-This is the source code of the GraphSL (Graph Source Localization) library to support the research and development of the graph learning community.
-
-# Introduction
-
-## Problem Definition
-
-![image](SL_example.png)
-
-Graph diffusion is a fundamental task in graph learning, which aims to predict future graph cascade patterns given source nodes. Conversely, its inverse problem, graph source localization, though rarely explored, stands as an extremely important topic: it focuses on the detection of source nodes given their future graph cascade patterns. As illustrated in the above figure, graph diffusion seeks to predict the cascade pattern $\lbrace b,c,d,e \rbrace$ from a source node $b$, whereas graph source localization aims to identify source nodes $b$ from the cascade pattern $\lbrace b,c,d,e \rbrace$. 
-
-Graph source localization spans a broad spectrum of promising research and real-world applications. For instance, online social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been instrumental in disseminating rumors and misinformation with significant repercussions. Additionally, the rapid propagation of computer viruses across the Internet, infecting millions of computers, underscores the critical need for tracking their sources. Moreover, in smart grids, where isolated failures can trigger rolling blackouts leading to substantial financial losses, graph source localization plays a pivotal role. Hence, the graph source localization problem demands attention and extensive investigations from machine learning researchers.
-
-The GraphSL library includes six state-of-the-art approaches and eight benchmark datasets.
-
-
-## Approaches
-
-![image](overview.png)
-
- Existing graph source localization methods can be categorized into two groups: Prescribed methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNN)-based methods.
-
-Prescribed methods rely on hand-crafted rules and heuristics. For instance, LPSI propagates infection in networks and labels local peaks as source nodes. NetSleuth employed the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the optimal set of source nodes and virus propagation ripple. OJC identified a set of nodes (Jordan cover) that cover all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius.
-
-GNN-based methods learn rules from graph data in an end-to-end manner by capturing graph topology and neighboring information. For example, GCNSI utilized LPSI to enhance input and then applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for source identification; IVGD introduced a graph residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible, and it devises a new set of validity-aware layers to project inferred sources to feasible regions. SLVAE used forward diffusion estimation and deep generative models to approximate source distribution, leveraging prior knowledge for generalization under arbitrary diffusion patterns.
